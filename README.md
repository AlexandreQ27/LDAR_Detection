# LDAR_Detection
## **Goals**

The goals of this project are:

-Our project is to detect whether the distance from the probe to the pipeline meets the criteria, utilizing machine learning

-This project aims to perform object detection and distance measurement using YOLOv5 object detection model.

## **How to work**
### **YOLO**
#### Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
PyTorch 1.7.0 or higher
OpenCV 4.2.0 or higher
NumPy 1.18.0 or higher
#### Installation
-1.Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```
2.Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.Download the YOLOv5 model weights from the official repository or from my project(yolov5s.pt)
